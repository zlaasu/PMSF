Please unzip these sprites and folder in `/static/`

In your config file you can change `$copyrightSafe = false;` if you want to want to load your map with original pokemon icons. 
If you want your map to keep loading with copyright safe icons but want to be able for your users to get pokemon icons you should leave `$copyrightSafe = true;` and your users should execute this JS script on your map (in console or 3rd party extension): 
`javascript:(function($) { Store.set('spritefileLarge', 'static/icons-im-1-bigger.png'); Store.set('icons', 'static/icons-pokemon/'); Store.set('weatherSpritesSrc', 'static/sprites-pokemon/'); })($)`
